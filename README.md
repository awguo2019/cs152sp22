# Free Verse Poetry Generator

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/awguo2019/cs152sp22/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Project Description

I'd like to train neural networks / utilize OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate poetry, or more specifically [free verse poetry] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_verse). Given an optional prompt, word count, and temperature value (how 'creative' or unique the output will be), the model will return a sample free verse poem according to the specifications outlined (and hopefully related to the prompt given). A dataset of free verse poetry will need to be created, probably through scraping internet forums (reddit api?) and webpages, alongside famous free verse poem books.

The trained model will be deployed as a web application where you can generate poems according to the specifications listed above, and if so desired, can share generated poems on social media platforms (additional feature if time permits). Additional extensions can include attempting to branch out to alternate forms of poetry (haiku, sonnet, etc), which would all require modifications to the dataset.

The longer-term goal of the project is to see if a computer, or neural net, is capable of producing art, writing that inspires meaning to the reader. I wonder if AI can shed new perspectives, new approaches to theese creative fields of generating written works, and if there's anything we can learn from an AI's writing style (which has been trained by humans). I hope to have fun with the model and see what it comes up with, and also see how to improve it as we go! This emerging field of text generation is incredibly exciting, and I hope to get a taste through this project.

## Project Goals
1. Create a dataset/corpus of free verse poems for our NN to "draw inspiration from".
2. Explore methods for making the writing more "human", and for making it more "creative".
3. Train a NN that is capable of generating a free verse poem (related to an optional prompt the user enters in). 
4. Deploy the NN as a web-app that the user can freely interact with.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/awguo2019/cs152sp22/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

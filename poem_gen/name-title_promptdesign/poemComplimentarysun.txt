The Sun


by Robert Hayden

Weeks ago it was winter, iced-in.   Now the thaw has come; see how everything                            is beginning to stir! The hardiest birds are back                                    again, and signed on every tree         are maps of new leaves in green possibility. Everywhere waiting things           grow restless for delivery             into season's fullness--              even this morning sun                         pours out warmth          as if part of some                      grand deliverance.                       Will we be ready?

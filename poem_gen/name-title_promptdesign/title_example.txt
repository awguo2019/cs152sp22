I 
Wept when none were by, 
And I wept alone- In the rain- on the flowery grave of one Who loved me long since dead; 
And died for me, as I had Often desired, but Could never die. 
II 
The tears fell From my eyes and Exhausted their strength 
In pouring upon his Cold clay 
which lay mocking 
My hot cheeks with its own Vitality quenched hardness. 
III 
"Why weep'st thou?" said a voice from Above: 
it was thine own! 
"'Tis better Thus to disappear in this dissolving form Of nature than to linger/ rotting out life."
IV 
Than to linger? Alas! To live is worse,- When life leads only To annihilation:- 
vaster my griefs become 
If consciousness endure That time would
lengthen into pain
And death at last come slowlier 
Drawing out each agony With icy torturing fingers Through futurity! 
vi 
What though cold dust lies o'er thy breast Which thrilled once at love like mine? Thou art now A thing that might have slept for ever,- Had not remorse impelled me hither Over thy lifeless remains

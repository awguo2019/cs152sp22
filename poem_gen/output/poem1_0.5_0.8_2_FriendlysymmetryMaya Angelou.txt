There is a symmetry in life 
That keeps us safely on track 
It's the beating of our hearts 
And the ticking of the clock 
Those gentle, insistent rhythms  
Keep us tethered to this world  
Lest we should float away    // Maya Angelou was an American poet, singer, memoirist, and civil rights activist.

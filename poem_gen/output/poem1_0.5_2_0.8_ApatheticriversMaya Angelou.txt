 
 are long and winding,
 
 They course through the land;
 
 They Sing a song of life, love and death.

 The rivers are our lifelines—they give us water to drink, to irrigate our crops, and to power our hydroelectric dams. But they also can be used as sewers for factories and cities, turgid with pollution. In this poem, Angelou speaks of the many moods of rivers—from serene and peaceful to dark and foreboding. And she reminds us that ultimately we all must return to them: “We come / To their banks weeping / We go from theirbanks laughing."

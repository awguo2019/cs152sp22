 
 The wind is like a great river, 
 flowing over the earth and through the trees. 
 It’s always moving, never still. 
 You can feel it in your hair and on your skin. 
 It’s cool in the summer and warm in the winter. 
 The leaves rustle and whisper secrets to each other   when the wind blows through them.

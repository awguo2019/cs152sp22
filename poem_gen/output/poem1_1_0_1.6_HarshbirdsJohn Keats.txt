They are so free, 
these soaring birds-- 
 their wild grace unbound by any earthly thing. 
 With powerful wings they ride the air, triumphant;  
 playful one moment, then suddenly aloof.   
Circling high above us all with ease, looking down 
on this small world far below them: what do they see?  
Our lives must seem so dull and slow to them...yet we long to be like them--to join that carefree flight.

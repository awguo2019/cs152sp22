 It comes to remind us 
 of life's lessons, 
 and what it means to be alive. 

 The rain is constant, ever-changing, yet always the same. 
 It falls on the just and unjust alike; witness to our triumphs and defeats.  

 When we are lost in sorrow or anger, the rain can help wash away our tears and allow us to start anew.  

 Sometimes soft and quietly whispering, at other times raging and thunderingâ€”the one thing we can be sure of is that the rain will never give up on us."

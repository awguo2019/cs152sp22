 
 The rivers are our lifeblood. They give us 
 sustenance and strength, refreshment and renewal. 
 We owe them a debt of gratitude, for they have much to teach us. 
 
 Listen to the roar of the river as it tumbles over rocks; see the way it winds its way through forests and fields; marvel at the power of its currents. And let us never forget that we too are like riversâ€”ever changing, always moving forward on our journey through life.

 
 Dark and unyielding,           
 It bubbles and boils             
 Slowly at first,                 
 Then all at once                  
                                   

 Spewing forth from the Earth's core,       (2)    
 Lava is both feared and revered         (3)         
 Its power to destroy is legendary   (4)            
 But so too is its ability to create    (5)          

 Volcanoes birth entire islands   (6)               
 Their molten rock reshaping the land     (7)       

 New worlds waiting to be born      (8)              

 From the lava comes new life          <9>

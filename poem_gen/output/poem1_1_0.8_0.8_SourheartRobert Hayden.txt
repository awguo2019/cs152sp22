The heart is a lonely muscle 
That works its will in silence 
and with great strength. 
Sometimes it is weary, sometimes at rest; 
subtlety and brute force areIts tactics and strategy. confirmed by defeatsAnd once in awhile By victories small and large it celebrates somethingWith an exuberance That stuns us: for we thought Its emotions Were dulled ordeadened And were astonished When the old ticker sprang To life again With allits former Fireworks intensity.

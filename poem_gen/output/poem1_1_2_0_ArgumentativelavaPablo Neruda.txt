 
 I choose to write about the lava, 
 that bright and hot red-orange substance 
 oozing like honey down a mountainside.  
 It's easy to think of it as just molten rock, but really 
 lava is so much more than that: it's fiery passion and rage,liquid life force bubbling up from the earth's core.

 Some say the world will end in fire, not ice--and if that's true, then lava is our planet' s beating heart, eternally cycling through birth and destruction. To stand near an active volcano is to feel the power of nature at its most primal and untamed. And yet there is something strangely beautiful about watching a river of lava slowly making its way towards the ocean , knowing that new land will be created in its wake .

I see them now and then,
these lithe and stealthy beasts,
 padding through the jungle shadows 
 or lazing in the sun. 
 And I am always surprised 
 by their beauty –  
the graceful lines of their bodies, 	     	    	         	   	        the striking stripes of their coat.                      It is easy to forget                                    that they are also deadly predators,                       until you catch a glimpse                         of those razor-sharp teeth                     or witness the power                  of those muscular haunches             as they spring into action.                Then you remember            why tigers have long been revered                   as one of nature’s most fearsome creatures.

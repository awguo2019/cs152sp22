 
 I saw the symmetry,  
 In leaves and branches,     
 Of frost on windows,        
 And in the faces            
 Of friends and strangers. 

 The world is symmetrical, 
 But often we forget; 
 Life can be chaotic--         
 It's easy to get caught                                  Up in our own minds. 

 So take a step back           And see the beauty            All around you--              In people and nature.

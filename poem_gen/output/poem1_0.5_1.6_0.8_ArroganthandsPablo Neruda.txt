Look at these hands, 
these workers' hands,  
these tired and calloused hands. 
They have built houses and bridges, 
tilled fields and sown seeds. 
They have held babies and been caressed by lovers. 
These are the same hands that have beaten down enemies  	     or lifted up those in need.   	       They are strong yet gentle; capable of both great violence and great tenderness.          Respect them for they are the givers of life itselfâ€”the toolmakers, the nurturers,          the safeguards against all harm.

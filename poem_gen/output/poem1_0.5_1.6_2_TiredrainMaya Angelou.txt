  
 is something that happens 
  to everyone,                               
 whether young or old.                        
 Some people like it                       
 and some don't,                 
 but as for me                   
 I enjoy the rain.                     It's      a chance           to            get wet,         to feel                       the cold        water                      on my skin,              and to dance in               the puddles    with     my children.             The best part of all though                   is lying in bed at night                   listening       to          the rhythmical fall   of each drop                    against our windowpane.

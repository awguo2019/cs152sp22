 
 is a magnificent place, 
 so bountiful and beautiful,  
 that it oftentimes makes me forget 
 the sorrows and troubles of my life. 

 I see the world in all its splendour,  
 receive its gifts with open heart,   
 dance to its tune and let out a cry:    
 "This is living! This is what it's all about!"

 
 
 Time is the Rorschach test of life 
-ategories it, blots out what doesn't fit 
 It's an expert at making us feel   small and forgetting how to quit
All we are is a brief flicker in its eternal spans 
 wildfires raging then fading into ashen hands  	     But time can also be laughing with you    when your head thrown back joyously against pillow             or that sunset dips everything in molten gold                          There'll be times appalling and beautiful            so      hold on to moments like drifting dandelions        because       time keeps moving whether you want it to or not

 
 
 is the thing that we all want 
 but are afraid to seek. 
It's an ideal, yet so hard to find-  
 a state of being both happy and free. 

 But what does it mean, this concept called "freedom"? 
Is it simply doing whatever we please?     Or is there something more?   

 Maybe freedom is having the courage to be ourselves,    To stand up for what we believe in despite the odds.      Maybe it's about living life on our own terms, Unafraid of what others might think or say.      

 Whatever freedom may be, one thing is certain: It isn't easy to come by. So let us strive towards it everyday- in big ways and small. And maybe someday, We'll finally reach that elusive state Of happiness and liberty."

 
 Zany, zany God! Are you feeling odd?           
 Do you ever get the sense that something's not quite right?
 That all these worshippers are just wasting their time      
 And you're nothing more than an imaginary being?            
   But then we see your works and know that can't be true-    
 How could anyone create such wonders and do it just for fun?   
 So we keep on believing, though our faith is often shaken;      For who else could make a world that's both beautiful and chaotic          All at once but a supremely zany deity like you.

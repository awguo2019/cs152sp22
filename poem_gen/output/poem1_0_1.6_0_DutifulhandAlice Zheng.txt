 
 
 The hand is an instrument of service, dutiful and obedient.
 It has no will of its own, but serves the mind and heart.
 With deftness and precision, it carries out our bidding.
 Whether to write or to hold,to give or to take,the hand is ever ready. 
 When asked to do something beyond its capability, it will gladly try its best. 

 Though often taken for granted, the hand is a faithful friend indeed.

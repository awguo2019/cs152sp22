 
 
 The world is like a carousel, 
 Dizzying and dazzling, always in perpetual motion. 
 It's filled with music and laughter, Caught up in the magic of the moment. . . until it isn't. 

 suddenly, without warning,   Everything can change In an instant- One tragedy , one act of violence And the whole world comes to a screeching halt. All that noise and color disappears Leaving only silence in its wake As we try to grapple With what has happened What could have been prevented If only we had paid more attention To the warnings signs That were there all along But we were too busy living life In our own little bubbles Not caring about anyone else Until it was too lateAnd then all we can do Is watch helplesslyAs the world crumbles around us

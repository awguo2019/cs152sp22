 
 The time will come when with elation 
 you will greet yourself coming into your own room 
 and declare before the mirror, "I have arrived!"  Arrived!  

 But that is not all.   There are moments of joy in life-but also those of woe.     Times when we cringe with guilt, regretting what we've done (or failed to do). These are times for atonement.    Sometimes our arrogance invites disaster,   as if fate wanted to show us how weak and clueless we really are.        Sooner or later Time presentsthe bill; and sadly, it's often overdue.     

 Still there are other occasionsfor celebration: birthdays, holidays...and just because days too lovely for ignoring          should be celebrated while they're here       All things must end but perhaps not now         Please don't let this day end just yet

  
 Is a wonderland 
 Of never-ending exploration,
 A map of winding rivers, mountains and valleys,
 That lead to hidden caves and secret places.

 Here is the seat of our emotions,
 The home of our fears and desires,
 The temple of our thoughts and dreams.

 Yet for all its mystery and majesty,   	 	 	 
 The body is but a frail vessel,     	 	  Between life and death.

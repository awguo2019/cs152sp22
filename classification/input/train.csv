0,"In womb I was fed on the extraction of her body
I played, moved there wether night or day
She bore me with great care
She more thought of me than other
About how I would be
When I might come on her lap
What she would name me
How she would rear me up;
At last her waitness came to an end
On a favourable day l came
She forgot the pains from she suffered
The eye balls of her I became;
How much love, care, adore are in the earth?
All she brings and inserts on me
She overcomes all difficulties of me
From womb to the last she does breathe;
I have observed at adolescence
I have remembered her presence
None is like mother how may be they our
Mother is just mother none is like her
However she is to all other
To me, after God is my mother."

You ask that I must again turn back with a gesture,
must go away from that which is safe and secure,
that I must accept changes in you and your family
and that everything does remain the same is no secret,
where you do expect that I have got to forget everything,
must come and face a similar lifelong barrage,
where I know of the breaking down of my humanity:
that your people do not even respect or regard me as a human being,
where you did bring about and speak out the end of our relationship
and then it was with you and your people's deeds night to me,
but now you do want that I break my intentions with someone else
as if there still remains something between us, you do expect:
that after all of this no change has come
and here I stand totally confused and astonished.

0,"I somehow seem to always comfort others with the words I want to hear
I hear myself telling people to stay srtong
And to hold on to what they love
And to let go of what is hurting them
And to work hard to earn what they want
And that everything's gonna end up just fine
And that eventhough it feels like the end of the world, it isn't
But when it comes to me
I'm the weakest person on earth
And I push what I love away because I fear getting hurt
And I hold on to what I know is of no good to me
And I expect to get what I want without working for it, but I don't, so I'm left with nothing
And I know for a fact that nothing really gets better:
I just get used to the situation I'm in
And the end of the world is basically every single night I'm alone with my thoughts
I've come to a conclusion that I crave seeing people being good at the things I'm bad at
I try my more than best to ensure the well-being of others while my own happiness is just an act so those I'm helping don't feel like there's something wrong
It's because I know what being down, being rejected, being hurt, and feeling worthless feel like, I don't want anyone to feel like that
I am not asking for your sympathy
I am not asking you to tell me words of comfort
Because this will only make me feel worse
And please, if you are going to say something, don't tell me that things are gonna be okay and that there is a light at the end of every dark tunnel
As I've said before, nothing really becomes 'okay'
And I know that every tunnel ends with a light
Just let me keep on doing what I'm doing because helping ones who have no one to hear them out or those who feel depressed or that nothing is right helps me, too, somehow
I think that by trying to understand others, it's one step closer to understanding myself
And in solving others' problems I find solutions to my own
I believe that the first step to knowing oneself is knowing others well as to discover what pleases or angers you and change your life to what suits you most"

Hold them tightly in hands

Upon a never ending ocean of time
They start off humbly before rising
Out of the gloom of their origins.
Forever reaching up towards the
Sacred searing light of the heavens
Searching for a promise of power
That is never found, or fully realized.
Those that bare witness to it can
Only marvel at it’s sheer decadence
And it’s raw, unlimited power which
Drives it’s endless, unsatisfied greed.
As quickly as it appeared it sinks away
Into the oblivion of the darkness which
Gave it birth, only for another to follow
In its wake, thus the cycle goes ever on."

Secret of success lies
In one's ability to collect
The scattered energies
And channel them singularly
Towards one focused goal.

A train of thought lost in the desert
Crashed on the tracks, while dripping out decisions
Which ran like butterflies
from the scene of a crime
Then words escaping, from earth quaking
Aftershock tore up Metaphors and allegories
Puncturing the reverb of the chromium parietal
Restart the engine with an artistic bandage
Took to meditating on a river
where I was fishing for a poem
With a diamond coloured spatula
When it jumped over my head into the forest
Evolving from a minnow into a whirlybird plane
that went through the clouds the led to the door
That went through the eyes
Of an ebony goddess
Whose lips were an enchantment
From a fiery catchment that she got from her father who was a
Voodoo Priestess who worked at the counter of a 7 /11
In Tucson Arizona, selling slurpies to teenagers
with terrible acne and who were friends with a ginger
with large ruby dimples
and who practised Kid Magic
from dungeons and dragons
that he trained on a bum who lost his legs in the war
and regrew into a centaur that re-examined his life
getting a licence as a real-estate agent, selling homes
in middle class suburbs where fluttered the noises
of faraway cities that eclipsed the distance
standing as columns of cavernous citadels,
Etched with in lime and volcanic basalt
You could see it half away in the form of a globe,
Tip it over and outpoured the wings of a poem
Unleashed as a phoenix with wings of a thesaurus
And as I searched for words of expression
It came fluttering in as a wrapped up present
and said to me;
'You cannot search for something that was already there'

Where tiles and the roof meet each other
they did build a nest from grains of mud
to hold the small ones safe
and with the neat building work I am astonished
and I wonder from what offspring they do get the mud
where I do constantly look at those small birds,
just before the rain do notice their antics in the air
when they swish to and thro and they do turn around and around
but when the blue-white thunder does sound ominously,
both do quickly swish to their nurturing-place,
are out of the wild stormy-wind when drops do fall,
are covered in their own small fortress
and like this the God of the universe also covers us
draws us close in His embrace like children.

Old Love
What love means to me is
a partnership of trust,
a merging of souls,
commitment a must.
It's not about ownership
or archaic vows to obey.
It's about loyalty, fidelity,
and sacrifices we make.
What love means to me is
a meeting in the middle.
Two souls functioning together,
both opposite, yet equal.
Like the motion of waves
love waxes and then wanes.
First, romance and excitment
then conpanionship gained.
What love means to me is
how you season the weather
surviving imminent tempests
then cuddling together.
Companionate love
is the ultimate goal
a love that means comfort
a love that's grown old.
what love means to me is
an assured kiss goodnight
from my best friend and lover,
on the left, to my right.

The weather has gotten very nasty
And it's causing a lot of heartache.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction on their wake
The weather conditions are so bad
They're bringing death and making a lot of people sad,
With all the death and disaster they have left just behind
Because of their houses, there's nothing left they can ever find
The severe weather is causing plenty of tornadoes, and floods,
And the wind starts to blow dreadfully, turning the ground below into a chaotic mud.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction in their wake
Folks might be terrified but they always have a courageous spirit, they are hurting
Right now and in their hearts they are mourning for all they have lost without a warning,
But life continues, some folks will go away, but some come back and start over again,
As life just goes on, rain just stops and the sun will shine again, thru each road and little plain
The weather has gotten very nasty
And it's causing a lot of heartache.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction on their wake.

I want to write always in free verse
In free verse there is no pressure.
I do not want to keep any goal
I really do not want any roll
I also do not want to play any role.
I want to see this earth free from hunger
Free from poverty and I do not want to
keep anybody within an artificial boundary.
I want to write always in free verse
I want to move freely from place to place
To see people in various glaze.

(in answer to Marius Absalom)
I smell the rain that pours down and keeps falling on the wet ground
when a lightning-bolt does come down blue-white in the concrete jungle,
but everywhere small groups of people stand around in the alleys
and I would escape back to the rural countryside if I could
while neon-lights keep advertising all kinds of things
and slowly I take step after step while evil does hang over the city,
the stars glitter far away above the lights and busy traffic
while I do long for better days and back to my childhood days
and there is a gambol, music and lights that drone and hum,
young people everywhere together do laugh happily and its dark night
and when a dark figure comes nearer and my heart skips a beat,
for danger I am ready and do expect the worst
but in a black leather jacket a much older man walks past
while the eternal longing for peace and tranquillity do remain in my heart.

The sea had shown me mercy
Purple twilight hid my angry, heart-break tears.
The pink horizon shimmered across my dreams.
Dreams lay abandoned on an island of woeful fears.
Purple twilight hid my angry, heart-break tears.
My heart ached to paint paisley waters of love again.
Dreams lay abandoned on an island of woeful fears.
Perfumed passion waned; I was marooned, without you.
My heart ached to paint paisley waters of love again.
I stood looking out at the sea as her waves frolicked.
Perfumed passion waned; I was marooned, without you
Roar of the sea echoed your laughter; your smile haunted me.
I stood, looking out at the sea as her waves frolicked,
All around me, I saw shadows of your perfect face.
Roar of the sea echoed your laughter; your smile haunted me.
Clouds of loneliness invaded my space at nightfall.
All around me, I saw shadows of your pefect face
Why was I abandoned, on this island of desolate longing?
Clouds of loneliness invaded my space at nightfall.
Who will find me, lost here, within this pitty-full shell?
Why was I abandoned, on this island of desolate longing?
I was awakened by an invasive early bright orange sunrise!
Who will find me, lost here, within this pitty-full shell?
I turned to run away from the intrusion of sunrise screaming!
I was awakened by an invasive early bright orange sunrise!
A smile from within me cracked the walls of dismay.
I turned to run away from the intrusion of sunrise screaming!
Upon the shore a precious pearl spilled, resting at my feet.
A smile from within me cracked the walls of dismay.
The pink horizon shimmered across my dreams.
Upon the shore a precious pearl spilled, resting at my feet.
The sea had shown me mercy.

A Poet Who Loves To Sing

Straight-backed upright the suricate sits on the anthill and watches the world
with small sharp eyes it's cut fine where it looks at the sky and ground,
as life can in one single moment totally stop,
an eagle can dive down or a predator could hunt where the others do dig
but nothing moves on the plain or is to be seen in the sky,
it's only heat waves that in the summer-sun do tremble
and the watcher looks ahead, to and thro and back again
where everything around him is living in abundance.
He becomes aware of a caracal sneaking nearer in the grass and do shrill,
in all direction to holes suricates do scatter
but then the veldt and everything is suddenly deadly silent
and forward on soft paws the sly cat sneaks
while every suricate waits deep down in the burrows,
while a babbler high up in a tree laughs at the world.

When language is used for expression
Words will improvise
Here comes an expert who is so smart
Devises a complex pattern
And hits us with a baton!
The poet cries....
His heart doesn't abide
The tears guide....
And poetry is revolutionized.

Whenever I hear birds singing
As I walk under tall, green trees
I shall think of you and smile
Whenever I hear a sweet wrapper
Rustling gently in the breeze
I shall remember you and smile
Whenever I long to hear the sound
Of your infectious, joyful laughter
I shall miss you always and smile.

Free Verse Version
This big ole egg named Humphrey
was perched on the top of
a high brick wall.
He fell off
It was a long way down
and he shattered his shell.
Someone call 911!
All the King's lackeys came with
a herd of emergency tech horses.
They tried to glue ole Hump
back together
but no luck.
Too many pieces
Tough grits!
Original Version
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King's horses
And all the King's men
Couldn't put Humpty
Together again.
Now I ask you.
Which version is better?
I kinda like the first one
How about another?
This shepherdess'
name was Bo Derek Peep
called Bo for short.
Somehow she
misplaced her sheep.
She looked high and low to no avail.
She didn't know
where else to look
so she just went and
had herself a brewski
and they eventually returned on their own
to the sheepfold
and they wagged their tails
in the back.
Where else?
You know the original so
I will not repeat for you.

Beauty with envy and hatred

(free verse) *Strictly For The Birds
I can tell when my cat has been chasing ducks.
He has that down-in-the-mouth look.
Which birds steal soap from the bath?
Robber duckies
When vultures fly are they allowed carrion luggage?
A raven has 6 pinions on each wing
A crow has 5 pinions on each wing
So the difference is a matter of a pinion
* free verse... prose on a poem site

Is it just me or does time seem
To move faster the older you get?
It almost feels like the world is
Moving too quickly and I must
Move with it or be left behind,
For the world waits for no man
I can remember back to when
I was much younger than I am now it
Doesn’t seem that long ago, does it?
Perhaps it does, but I’m not certain
I can remember things, things that
Seem like they happened yesterday
But they don’t seem real somehow
The person in those memories is not me
Well, at least not the me that I am now
I have changed, the endless march
Of time has made sure of that but
I am not sad and I am not bitter
I have become a husband and a father,
And because of those precious gifts
I long to know what other beautiful things
I may become with the turning of the world;
But even the wonderful blessings which
May come in the years ahead make the
Speeding of time no less strange or frightening.

Dream on with your life,
Keep dreaming because you’ll,
Never get this back,
Dream on till you can’t dream no more,
Because when your done dreaming
I won’t be there no more,
I will be long gone,
Not thinking of you,
So dream on till there are no memories left, ,
I don’t want to be caged,
My heart tells me it wants to be free,
Not locked up in one spot,
Dream on with your life,
Go find someone new,
Don’t bother with me anymore,
Because I’m long gone by now,
So Dream On.

She is so proud of her beauty and color
That I want much adoring her
She keeps her at far in a sweet temper
As she is seen in the picture,
But when I return from outside
She touches me with her body and tail
To attract me to demanding care
Sometimes she hugs me by my leg
To complain any body's misbehave,
She is my adorable pet cat
Whom I am fond of very much, thus
A mutual fondness has developed
As she follows me even at midnight
To obey any dear command.

How I yearn to write in free verse,
Free from rhymn, cadence and
Free to roam about ethereally,
In some never-never land.
The muse of Erato is upon me. I have an urge,
an urge to write with vagueness and abstraction,
to cloak my meanings in surrealism and mystery.
Perhaps, I could write of passion, joy, sadness,
despair, longings, angers, envies and doubts. I
could write of depressions and elations, using
platitudes and beatitudes. I must write of sad
yesterdays and hope-filled tomorrows and tell
of my misty dreams and future schemes. Ah! -
Yes, these would be good topics, free from the
shackles of rhyme. My sucess depends on your
ability to interpret what I have written. I may yet
become the Picasso of poetry.
But when I take my pen in hand
To write new poetry,
It still comes out in rhythmic form,
Dear Lord, please set me free!

Beauty with harm
Is not beautiful at all
Here beauty is real
Beautiful is false

Harm and to be harmful are helly
To be beautiful
Need harmless attitude and to be beneficial.

Your land is dry, barren and hard
And going to be desert
How will you make it cultivable?
Have you water?
Water is power
Not only to humans, animals, plants
But to land
Our life is dependent on all these.

A beautiful girl
Patiently waiting for something
In the warm bright sun
Now walks
Onto the street
Where cars rush about
She is hit and a crowd gathers around
Her corpse rises from the centre of the crowd
Turns to me and whispers
“Watch your step…”

(after Ina Rousseau)
Where each one of us stands on the stage of the world,
where our own lives are a scene before the universe
on a earth full of great darkness
Your bright searchlight does cut its own way,
each person's turn does come to go on
and the great secret of the spectacle
brings to everyone a unique meaning
where some do loose their lives for You,
like a player in a leading role or just a figure
do play out their roles for the last time,
others do unexpectedly disturb the lives of others,
do lead them off the road running to the other side
and the time is running out before the curtain does fall
while You do still perform as the big director.

Running through the dark
lights and trees whipping past.
Claws shred the earth
and fur blows in the wind.
Fangs drenched in blood
my core burning in rage.
Wolves are extremly loyal
but just as posessive as well.
I'm her pet and she's
MY master as well.
curling at her feet, it feels nice.....
to be so close.
I nudge her leg gently with my muzzle
and look up into her golden eyes.
I'm happy she cares about me....
So rare...
Night is my domain
and my mistress.

(Love Never Ends: Free Verse)
Once you love truly
Then see, never ends
In all stages of life it exists immortally;
I say, ""I love, I love"", if it is in heart
Happy or sad heart bears it forever;
I am here, I am there,
Nothing matters
It follows everywhere,
Every path it crosses
Even, uneven, chaotic, full of thorns
Up to reach the destination,
On the way it may be hurt
But does not get death, anyway
Like soul love is unseen
And fully immortal,
You love really
It will make you believe definitely,
After hurt it will ferment
Will get much vigor, power
Then at destination
It becomes heavenly one
And never ends.

The high moors lie beneath a changing Sky
As seasons in their turn assume the throne
The landscape changes yet remains the same.
Cosmetic changes superficially
appear to alter what is permanent.
Changing perceptions of what we can see
by adding or subtracting colouring
The pleasant shades of green wrought by the spring
The hues of summer heather dominates
and autumn paints the moors in shades of gold.
Then winter shows monochrome artistry.
Uninhabited. uninhibited
The high moors appear to be desolate
and yet sustain more life than meets the eye.
The circling hawks on high can see their prey
and stooping, swiftly expertly they dine.
They take some small life to sustain their own.
Obeying Natures rule kill or be killed.
The high moors can be very dangerous
especially to the uninitiated.
Their beauty attracts both wise men and fools.
And yet there is no place I’d rather be
Alone, or with congenial company.

I admire all the aims of Free Verse,
‘tis explicit in all that I do
in shaping the stress to converse
with a rhyme-scheme restricted to two.
That I stay with this number is true, -
a linguistic abuse, maybe worse,
how it weighs and encumbers the view! -
but French art needs its aid, though perverse.
Else the Muse would be dumb to a curse,
for to accent, the lingo’s deaf too, -
though what can one do?  All’s averse
to fantasy rhyme calls on cue!
May Free Verse’s aims bring joy unto
the young sparks who chance meanings coerce -
whose mental gymnastics’ fun value
is the fire to inspire hopes they’d nurse.
They’re young colts who green pastures traverse
with gravity worthy their virtue,
though mad they’re superb, and no hearse
they’d inherit! Free Verse tempts!  You too?

My blood-shot eyes blink away existence
Unfamiliar voices roll through my brain
Gravity’s unseen hands pull me to the earth
I find their spell far too charming to fight.
Awful bells start to toll in my head, they play
Their terrible tune of death, so seductively
A searing light of pure white beats at my face
As the tolling draws me closer to it’s calling.
I ascend into a white tunnel shining above me
But my body stays on the cold, hard ground
I’m so free from the burden of my fleshy clothing
So naked and fragile, like a screaming newborn.
My heart’s rhythmic beating calls to me longingly
I fall back into the warm sanctuary of my body
I take a breath and feel so blessed  to still be alive
But all I can think about is the searing white light.

When you think and feel
in terms of iambs or trochees
and sing them in series within,
you feel the pulse of a regular
rising or falling rhythm.
The recurring feet or beats make the lines
monotonous or surfeiting;
may be dull and flat at times..
The increasing anapaests
Makes  the movement fast
But dactyls keep the tempo slow.
The epics and long tales of the past
with thrilling and grilling events
recharged our minds to linger long
in tasting of those sonorous lines.
You pen the shoddy lines
of words and phrases you think,
with a natural mix of humour and rhetorics
images and word-music
in long end-stopped or short enjambed ones.
Free verse lines of syncopation
blossom out of syncronised patterns
to sing the beauties of the mundane
and supreme things.

Forty word poem.
'Lowell-Lowell' the poets did say
When Industrial Revolution came to stay.
Concord and Merrimack flowed merrily,
Birds singing songs, children at play.
'Sword Blades and Poppy Seeds'
was Poem of The Day. Life seemed
so gay down Massachusetts' way.

Sadly, to me
This thing they call Prose
Is naught but just talk,
And often verbose;
I think it's too easy
And honestly, I'm
Just wanting to say
I much prefer rhyme.
And almost the same is the
Form called Free Verse,
It isn't for me, I'm not keen,
And what's worse:
Explaining the differences
Should be a breeze,
But even amongst the 'experts'
No one agrees.
Now I'm no academic
But I won't be fooled
By the 'cleverer' people,
By the so-called, 'well-schooled';
I favour good rhyming
O'er Free Verse or Prose,
And I'm calling to mind now
The Emperor's New Clothes.

Consummate pain
Like a cruel wrench
Gripped his heart
And crushed, it bled
A father's tears.
No words define
His anguished grief
A wretched loss
His own son...
His seed.
The baby he carried
In his arms
And nurtured
In paternal love
Now broken, scarred
A shriveled man
His father's eyes
Now bleed.
He would take him back
To be his child
Return him safely
To his past
No war could touch him
Hidden there
His eyes see through
An hourglass.
My boy, my son!
What have they done?
Your life a mangled mess
What's left to do?
These father's tears
Will not replace
The boy, the man
That I once knew!

(after Lucas Malan)
What does a person know about the man that stands at the traffic light
in the hot sun away from the shadow of the trees in the lane
with a board in his hand on which he is begging for money and aid
and many think that he is too rotten to work and so his life does go on.
The religious zealots or the colporteur that knocks at the door is the one
that everywhere does dare his life against dogs that want to tear him apart,
do want to set a view of God to you or do want to sell religious books,
do sometimes want to warn the entire world about what is about to happen
and if Jesus Christ in person does come to have a friendly conversation,
shyly like a boy walks to the front door and do come and ask
for water and you see that He is carrying many miles
will you recognize Him and do your door swing open wide
or do you show Him away like all of the others
and shout:""get out of your own mess by yourself! ""

(for Annelize)
I adore you late at night, at daybreak and in the afternoon,
even if the days of hardship would come without an end,
even if all of life did only flower as thistles
it would do nothing to my love for you,
even if I had to reconcile myself with another person in your life,
for years you will still have me speechless
where I do love you still in my later years
as love do not set demands to fulfil,
it only leaves its own lovely tracks deep in the heart
and like the seasons nothing can stop it
where it lasts for decades and go far past the aeons,
it brings healing and happiness instead of sorrow,
it is something that do includes all great things and also hope
and with my love I want to envelope your whole world.

I had been lost deep into the big city,
in alleys circling almost endless around me
with only the fuel fumes
hanging almost cuddling around.
In alleys circling almost endless around me
I could not find my way in the darkness
hanging almost cuddling around,
I could not even see the stars.
I could not find my way in the darkness
with only the fuel fumes,
I could not even see the stars:
I had been lost deep into the big city.

A moving tree having various sections of branches
Of hope, despair, success, failure, vices and virtues
That inwards roots and outwards the saplings grow
With a course in mysterious way of moving to and fro
Through rough, plain, desert, forest, ocean, mountain
Straight, curving, zigzag, back-forth and up-down;
With all the liking-disliking colours−
White-black, red-grey, yellow-blue and ash-green
With some inevitable weathering facts−
Summer, spring, winter, autumn and late autumn
With some mixing emotions and temperaments−
Liking-disliking, loving-hating, laughing-crying
With some destructive and breath choking vices−
Envying, spoiling, shooting, bombing, killing
Again with some angelic qualities−
Praying, helping, making, thinking, inventing
With all there are some unavoidable plights−
Beginning, romance, curious, fierce, tumultuous
Mid, fit, unfit, calm and ultimate ending
Without noticing, informing, testing or warning.

(after Etienne van Heerden)
As a child he was taught that the judgement day of God would come,
of angels that do hold a laager of protection around him,
where the pastor and Sabbath School of the church said
that God's territory is everywhere and limitless
and he believes that he serves the Lord sincerely and faithfully,
that God does even witness the smallest injustice on earth,
do shoot with his catapult the mynahs to death
where they peck at the other birds like demons that some feathers are lost,
do hear the babbler roaring with laughter at him
and believes that it's a message coming from God
that right and righteousness must occur everywhere
as the world is the jurisdiction of God
where the doves again sing their songs of praise,
of a God that do even to birds bring salvation.

On a fine morning, she died
–like in the chick flicks, and ‘don’t-know-how-to-end-it’ romance novels.
Like her, It was a rare disease that took her by surprise,
It wasn’t her choice – it would never be
had she had the chance.
This was her first and only time she fought and lost a fight.
‘cause she always got what she asked for – even in love,
Her eyes were the first to sparkle, and ask and that’s how it started between us.
I wouldn’t lie –Looks did play a part – she was gorgeous, and after we fell in love,
She was the most gorgeous woman in the world – even when she was laid to rest.
We began to talk all the world we knew,
and with surprisingly’ Born & Lost & found again’ twin- like qualities,
we both regretted that we had lost a hell lot of time -
From the cradle itself – and we had to make up for all of it
And spend every moment we got –together.
She: 'Are we silly? '  Me: 'No, We are beautiful people! '
We had made, lots of plans –
Unspoken and yet we both knew.
‘cause we believed in dream lands and Wuthering Heights
Ancient Classics on the radio, poetry, Victorian novels and less television,
More moments together in silence, deeply smitten;
In all, we wanted ours to be, the best love story ever written.
We bought little gifts from whatever change we had in our pockets,
Strange items from the 1$ store –an Angel made in China
– targeted at us types – sold, accepted with a smile;
musical greeting cards –which got me my first kiss,
and I started to give her a card every day;
and roses that were always not fragrant or fresh enough.
Remember Love letters? – There was always something to write,
exclusively handwritten with a fountain ink pen on paper – folded,
posted into a large red box called the post-box;
and we waited in thrill to read our letters that reached us a day later...
–we  had all the time of our lives.
We were both often tongue-tied to say anything at all
after a ‘hello’ on the phone.
Her voice did that to me,
and she claimed that my boorish grumble  did that to her as well.
And..there was getting drenched in the drizzle...
–blame our books if you want to,  we wouldn’t;
Our Picnics in the meadows, home made cookies (her mom made them) ,
Sipping green tea and watching the clouds pass by.
As time flew and we noticed,
we now talked about the right time to get together-
To turn the house i owned into our ideal home - that’s thankfully hard to locate
by our ‘convenience, cash-borrowing sake’ friends;
‘Cause we were selfish, and we wanted each other for several more years.
In a so called modern world where everything and anything old worldy
was not in anymore,
We laughed at the diabetes epidemic that infected the cultured minds,
And we happily indulged in the sickeningly sweet ways;
-We didn’t give a damnation. “Jealousy! ” She remarked. I agreed.
We spoke the same words; and rarely thought or talked differently,
‘Cause - She was me and I was She.
In all,  the ‘uncool and unreal’ stuff on hallmark channel
–suspended reality of today based on Lost values, Frozen in time
and Memory (again, an old line)    -
We believed in the old fashioned thing called Love. - Pity you!
After her death, it was like the end of times,
like in the books;
Birds sang sad songs;
The little squirrel that came down for bread crumbs waited for her
And left disappointed; the flowers drooped their heads in mourning for a few days
– so, It was all real!
I snapped out of it all, and brought the world back on its feet,
The world needs to go on, in spite of me.
The life that used to be for us and around us, came back to life.
As comforting words stopped from friends;
I continue to live with her- her memory,
And I begin to build the dream home we wanted
Slowly she started to appear,
No apparition, or ghoul or ghost  - but actually her
As she quietly watched and smiled, and was all around when our home
Came to life.
The chrysanthemums and tulips for the garden;
Bird baths and bird houses;
A French window that opened into the woods;
No electric fencing ‘cause it’s dangerous for the animals;
No bloody television – the outside world doesn’t change for good in 24 hours,
and the morning paper was enough;
Ah.. the fireplace – the moments we shared, just looking deep into the fire
In deep embrace, feeling the warmth and our hearts beating together
To the sounds of wood splinter and crackle – i retained the fireplace as it was.
She wanted her own black beauty – a gorgeous stallion
and a pickup truck; our dreams grew on and we had to work harder -
to bring our picture post card aspirations to life.
A loan that will help take lease of the used books store in town and turn it into a library
- our humble idea to have a regular supply of titles.
We were always realistic in our world – believing, hoping and loving.
We could open the books and relive the stories again,
Dream the lost dreams-channels have re-runs, don’t they?
I got it all happening, God’s grace,
‘cause we would never like our dreams to fail,
while I still run the bakery – going on the same way.
The pastries are missing something – customer complaints
for which I know the answer
but cannot explain the ‘missing ingredient’ to them.
We never kept diaries, ‘cause we remembered whatever that mattered to us
and that was enough.
Her dreams, our dreams and our life was all that mattered – love mattered.
And that was enough.
Conversations happen now and then
with the people I occasionally bump into and
as usual, they talk as though they were always there to care –
Them: “Are you seeing someone again? You have to move on! ”
Me: “Sorry! Wherever I go, She goes.”
“I shan’t betray her memory! I feel her in the wind when I walk;
“I feel her, see her in everything I touch”;
I feel her comforting me, giving me company in my aloneness! ”
I would live and die as her beau! ”
Them: Frowns. “They were never in touch with reality! ”
“Thank you. For once we agree, I didnt believe in your reality.”
We never asked anyone to believe us or in what we believed in.
I continue to dream and  build our home
-The fire had died out, but the warmth hasn’t.
The winds still carry her beautiful songs,
They might bring them back to me after every bird has learnt it.
I wake up in the morning, and look first at her face,
Her eyes closed in sleep, and the little smile on her face,
I can feel she’s still dreaming.
The books we really loved always ended
with ‘Then, they lived happily ever after.”
We are living, happily, ever after.

Desire
Lips sealed with a kiss
Lips parted for more
Don't you know my love
Desire for ever more
The saga of ancient lore
Maya (Illusion)    In Nature
I am the Eve of your Garden
Defamed by fate's cruel hand
I bore you in me as a thought beautiful
Carry the energy per your command
I am but the executrix of your deeds.

Free verse
Push my nail in skin while reading
What is this?
We have burned rhymes, meters!
No Secrets
Yet shameless we insist ‘is poem'
Junk poems
""Baby pissed"", ""The bird hissed""
Write or say
Empty is nonsense; or worthless
Time wasted
Does it have a message?
Will it be ambiguous?
Where is the beauty?
Where's softness?
It is exact; the tattoo of Rumi:
""Oh it hurts""
""This later""
""Not here'
And it ends:
""Has ever been lion without head, no tummy and no tail? ""

Late in the afternoon over the sea
the day poured out the last out of its wineglass,
the bay, the wave is coloured red
when on the beach you do kiss me.
Next to the coast our love lays step upon step,
at high tide the moon is beautiful to you,
our castles lie scattered on the sand
when water in and out wiping all things of us clear.
The stars stretch almost unending wide,
the lighthouse at Danger Point limps on and off
and you find God's poetry in the night,
tell that in the universe a struggle rages,
far away dogs are barking continually
and in the moonlight your face glows softly.

(after C. M. van der Heever)
The orange-red moon rises as if it is sailing in the sky
where the last rays of the sun do disappear
and the long row of oak trees are etched in their outlines
as if the sun is still writing its last message
before the darkness totally absorbs the last light
while blue-white the evening star do already shine
and predators hunt to survive in the death and pain of others
while crocodiles and hippopotamuses come out with their clumsy bodies
and there is a fine balance between life and death
that hangs over the whole earth like a web
while birds of prey do glide in the darkness
and like this everything in a way is caught
even man who do strive as a higher being
to noble things and also to his own interest.

With Love, Time is not
Nor space and distance matter
Ribboned passion in a knot
One loving heart tied with the other.
With Love,  Age is not
Nor even Status break attraction
Kings give up thrones, and all of that
For his lady love's deep affection.
With Love,  Race is  not.
For Color fades in Cupid's arrow
It conquers all,  no matter what
Blind to the sight  is what lovers know.

She is Tom
Tom pet,
Pet cat,
She was born in 2015
On March 7,
In coming March she will be 3
Yet she has no kitten;
She is not a normal cat,
She does not bear any cat
She is fond of living with human;
Though she is pet,
She lives independently;
She does not like to obey commands
Her motives are often unknown, ........

I admire all the aims of Free Verse,
In all I write rightly explicit
Regardless of stress and of meter
And with Capital Letters to boot.
One onwards plods petty, proasic,
Even worse, with linguistic abuse,
As for spelling, why, rules and times changing,
No core...erections once inked I think fair.
Terpsichore would be dumb could not dance,
Prose to accent and scansion stays deaf,
While to harmony all seems averse
Calls on cue for vain ego's applause.
Free Verse tractor drives, pastures green
Are ploughed to prepare literary
Slums which spurn mental gymnastics
Burning faith in fair future hopes held.
'There is no poetry in money,
No money in poetry' either,
As returns fall returns must increase,
Squeezing readers', booksellers' illusions.
This rant could continue for years
with cadence most messy maintained,
with readership bored into tears...
Oops! There's rhyme unintended! Oh curse!

I admire all the aims of Free Verse,
‘tis explicit in all that I do
in shaping the stress to converse
with a rhyme-scheme restricted to two.
That I stay with this number is true, -
a linguistic abuse, maybe worse,
how it weighs and encumbers the view! -
but French art needs its aid, though perverse.
Else the Muse would be dumb to a curse,
for to accent, the lingo’s deaf too, -
though what can one do?  All’s averse
to fantasy rhyme calls on cue!
May Free Verse’s aims bring joy unto
the young sparks who chance meanings coerce -
whose mental gymnastics’ fun value
is the fire to inspire hopes they’d nurse.
They’re young colts who green pastures traverse
with gravity worthy their virtue,
though mad they’re superb, and no hearse
they’d inherit! Free Verse tempts! You too?

Vers Libres
J’admire l’ambition du Vers Libre, -
Et moi-même que fais-je en ce moment
Que d’essayer d’émouvoir l’équilibre
D’un nombre ayant deux rhythmes seulement?
Il est vrai que je reste dans ce nombre
Et dans la rime, un abus que je sais
Combien il pèse et combien il encombre,
Mais indispensable à notre art français.
Autrement muet dans la poésie,
Puisque le langage est sourd à l’accent.
Qu’y voulez vous faire? Et la fantaisie
Ici perd ses droits: rimer est pressant.
Que l’ambition du Vers Libre hante
De jeunes cerveaux épris de hazards!
C’est l’ardeur d’une illusion touchante.
On ne peut que sourire à leurs écarts.
Gais poulains qui vont gambadant sur l’herbe
Avec une sincère gravité!
Leur cas est fou, mais leur âge est superbe.
Gentil vraiment, le Vers Libre tente!
Paul VERLAINE 1844_1896 Epigrammes

When sunsets for night sorrow drifts in, whispering through the trees.
Her gown flutters through the air  as she glides over me.
Setting quietness throughout the land,
In a dangerious whisper that gave me shivers.
The despair settled over me, as her calming deadly wrath,
Wrapped me in a blanket of sadness.

Long day at school,
Dark and gloomy
.Everyone is pulling my last nerve,
The nerve that can not stretch no more.
I’m all out of drugs, marijuana, cocaine,
O well the weren’t helping any way.
Why do I take them, I don’t understand
My level is still the same.
I open the door to this dump of a room,
Finding the nearest knife
The darkest corner is never here
In the day time it’s all light
I sit on my bed,
Making regretting scars
On the vein that I have last
Redness appears,
But that’s just the stress that I deal with in a day I
’m bullied and tossed all over the field,
Acting like I don’t care
The colours of the rainbow are changing for me,
From brightness to grey
Now, I’m bleeding all over the floor
But the real pain hurts inside
The hearts that’s broken can’t beat without you,
Bearing to stay apart.: (

(free verse) * A Great Grandfather's Lament
I have children
and they have children
and one of those children has a child
but no one writes to me
not even Daemon (who is almost three)
And I am not even Jewish

* free verse... prose on a poem site

Weavers do twitter, warblers chirp and doves coo
and the summer overflows with joy
but for the cat that do try to murder the birds
where from the branches of the fig tree the birds peep
and in the days of the summer I am swept away
by all of the birds that so cheerful do sing in their choir
and do notice them splash and drink at the water bowl
when they do flutter down and I do feed them crumbs
and every bird does sing an own love-song
that continually does sound up with joy
as if all of creation do enjoy this summer,
the birds land as if the fruit trees do beckon them,
know that they do offer seed and fruit to them
and I can think of no other better summer.

(for Annelize, after I. D. du Plessis)
Your love is a pure light
that radiates my whole world
and you do love me intimately
when you do determine holy times for me,
where every word and deed
like nard do flow over me,
where constantly you do leave me speechless
where you do sacrifice yourself and do bleed,
do constantly treat me with great respect,
do overwhelm me with the person that you are
without me asking for any of this
as if you are acting in an unspoken secret way
and in your silent submission where you do serve me
it is the core of love that I do witness.
[Reference:""Die vlam"" (The flame)by I. D. du Plessis.]

(for Annelize)
You are the one that I do trust with all my secrets
above all other women you are utter beautiful to me,
wonderful even when you do turn my world upside down,
you are the fortress that I do build against the world,
in the silent moments I think about you
and even if the black-collard barbet twitters the day red,
even if the frost of life is spread out everywhere
I pray to God to hold His hand over you,
heroic as a warrior you stand at my side,
are not blinded by the insanity of gossip
but it's with sincere love that you do come to me
where you are vulnerable but also a heroine to me
and I trust in our love and on God like a child
when day after day you astonish me with your humanity.

(after I. D. du Plessis, in answer to N. P. van Wyk Louw)
Motionless like skeletons the branches hang stripped, the summer is past,
the air is stuffy and the clouds are grey and black and heavy,
the wind rustles through the dry earth grabs here and there a leave,
etched against the dark sky stands the gigantic oak trees in a long row
where you get an impression of the eternal waiting of trees,
of the winter that is coming with the first chill of the fall
but still the doves do sing their love songs where they do woo
when swarms of other birds do trek away to avoid the iciness,
where the sun does break through at place after place but still hangs dull dying,
the oaks gleam dull black, do gigantic stick their fingers into the sky,
while the grassy veldt yellow-brown do stretch into the distance
when a person does long back to the fruitful days of summer
and do find God in the silence of the resting time that suddenly does come
when the first snow does cover the peaks of the Hottentots Holland Mountains.

Dewdrops hang like diamonds on the web and sparkle in the light
where a small black spider do wait patiently for an insect,
between prickly pears, in this construction the weight of the spider rests
when the sun rise over the horizon in an open new day.
The girl Arachne dares to challenge the goddess Athena to weaving
and where Athena makes a tapestry of the gods in their splendour,
the fine work of Arachne of their romances is lovelier,
where Athena tears that piece of art to shreds according to the old story
Arachne hangs herself on the strings for life and death
where she views herself equal to Athena and do to eternity spin webs,
as a spider having to catch insects for a life
and still do hang in her rebellion against the gods on her web
from where she does daily look upon Athena in arrogance
and keeps herself eternally cursed as a prisoner of her own will.

You are like a beautiful feather
That flutters upon a gentle breeze
I stand in silent wonder trying to
Not disturb your fragile journey
I bend down and kiss your forehead
And whisper in your ear ever so softly,
“You are as brilliant and inspiring as the
Dawning sun, for when I gaze at you
The darkness of the world fades away
Into nothingness; and is replaced by
Your warm and pure luminous beauty.”

I now delight
In spite
Of the might
And the right
Of classic tradition,
In writing
And reciting
Straight ahead,
Without let or omission,
Just any little rhyme
In any little time
That runs in my head;
Because, I’ve said,
My rhymes no longer shall stand arrayed
Like Prussian soldiers on parade
That march,
Stiff as starch,
Foot to foot,
Boot to boot,
Blade to blade,
Button to button,
Cheeks and chops and chins like mutton.
No! No!
My rhymes must go
Turn ’ee, twist ’ee,
Twinkling, frosty,
Will-o’-the-wisp-like, misty;
Rhymes I will make
Like Keats and Blake
And Christina Rossetti,
With run and ripple and shake.
How pretty
To take
A merry little rhyme
In a jolly little time
And poke it,
And choke it,
Change it, arrange it,
Straight-lace it, deface it,
Pleat it with pleats,
Sheet it with sheets
Of empty conceits,
And chop and chew,
And hack and hew,
And weld it into a uniform stanza,
And evolve a neat,
Complacent, complete,
Academic extravaganza!

no matter how much it seems to hurt,
it happens again and agian
tears are running down my cheeks,
saying that i'll regret this.
no matter what happens,
i'm always alone.
with no one on my side,
but i'm not alone,
others do the same.
what will happen when we are done?
with nothing left,
my heart cries out, unknowingly,
with no reason for misery.
it's like the death of an angel,
all over agian,
in the silent screams i hear.

What is free verse! ? What is free verse! ?
I'll tell yer what's free verse!
Free verse? That's when the poet gets nuffink!
Not a penny, not a sausage for his poem...
He spent hours on that poem, yeah, hours...
Nobody spent a penny on buying his poem.
He had to pay for his home and his car.
He had to pay for his family's food and clothes.
He had to pay for his paper and pen and typewriter.
He had to pay for his computer and his printer.
He had to pay electricity, water and gas bills.
He had to pay VAT and the terrible TV licence tax.
He had to pay for his phone line rental and Broadband.
He had to pay for every flipping thing!
Nobody else helped him. Nobody sponsored him.
Free verse? That's what poets share with skinflints!
Yeah, that's what free verse is. It's free...
But it's won too free if you ask me!
Denis Martindale April 2017.

He walks alone,
In misery of others.
Hiding in the shadows,
Of the schools walls.
When reaching a trip home,
Swallowing what’s called a drug,
There are always different kinds.
A fierce battle is fought when he gets home,
More loss’s than wins
Against his parents.
For them he is nothing,
Just what they have produced.
16, but money is what they dread to give.
Topple over to his room; find a corner that’s dark.
Blood gushing out, from a cut that he’s made
Revealing they stress, for that single day
Why is he different, can’t be the same,
He did exactly like the drug dealer claimed.
BUT WHERE IS THE FAME,
HE WANTED SO MUCH.
If he thinks he deserves it,
Think again, not believing your luck.
There are other ways, which he could get friends?
Give me a second; he should have used his head.
Now staring down on the scars he regrets,
The numbness will never leave his body,
Slowly as his head changes colours,
He went to deep sleep,
The sleep where one can’t be woken.
Congratulations, my sleepy head,
Now you’ll be remembered, recognized.
Isn’t that what you wanted?
Or maybe in a different way,
Wouldn’t it be better getting a job than laying this way?
Rather than how you handling your parent this way.
But what could you do,
When everyone around
Has been doing the things that they call
“Popular.”
Not necessary to fit in,
When you are hurting yourself.
Be a team on your own,
It’s lonely, but, it’s the only way to protect you.
Hearing about the break ups,
The hook ups, the crowds
The girl friends and boy friends,
Can’t have one, that’s no shock.
He is laying dead, some where,
Look at what these people have turned him,
Living a life in high school, not easy.

In heart, in thought, in mind
If I hope for
I love;
If I find,
I am lucky;
If in true way
I spend my short life with I love,
I am successful;
It is true love I claim
As flower it does bloom
Spreads beauty and purity
Around its branches
Then at far distance;
Raises me over wrong
Keeps me far from sin;
It knows my existence
It knows my soul,
With it I am whole
Without it I am empty,
It shows me right way,
Absolute path
Nothing after that;
It is my happiness
It is my soul's ambition
It is my soul's salvation
It is my final contentment;
For this love I will sail far
Crossing all the oceans
All the dangers
Over there;
Follow it all the loves
To make me real lover
And forever,
Come every moment
Every day
Every month
Every year
Every era,
On the way
I go pass,
Shake my right hand,
I stand,
Turn around,
I find
Love
True love;
Now I feel immortality
True love dismisses mortality
Here
And hereafter
Nor for being emotionally feat
But true at day light.

The NBA such an exciting league
Players working hard and avoiding fatigue
Various Dunks and three's
And steals to retrieve
All this work for one goal
To win the championship and take control
A very exciting game that's for sure
The NBA something everyone should endure

(in answer to C. M. van der Heever)
The roses fold open their deep-red cups
where with a soft fragrance they do entice
when one after the other they do open with the sun
where it dips everything over the hillocks bloody red,
everything becomes brighter as the day continues,
Day lilies and morning glories follow the sun as it goes,
there is rejoicing in everything that does exist in the summer-days
where the redbreast, weavers and doves do walk to and thro.
Butterflies, beetles and bees frolic from flower to flower
where they gather nectar and everything is fertilised and impregnated
as if the existence of everything is threaded deep into each other,
the birds do peck the fruit that comes to fullness
and bright white-hot the sun hangs high in the sky
in the great cycle of nature's secrets.
[Reference:""Alles gee verniet"" (Everything gives in vain)by C. M. van der Heever.]

Flowery tracks disuse attacks, forsaken are by all but weeds.
Restating harmony and form, modernity sows mutant seeds.
Estranged outpourings of lost souls lose touch with life rejecting rhyme,
Excising zest which stood the test, that spanned vicissitudes of time.
Verse draws its force from intercourse divine which intuition feeds,
Extending more by fits and starts than leaps and bounds, but healthy breeds
Responses in the innter heart, the soul that seeks no empty climb,
Sensing the need to feel and feed the flame of an enlightened clime.
Ephemera now litter presses, most express a bitter creed,
For words are symbols, cymbals strong, colours the poet’s palette needs,
And sudden subtle tender touches cover surface smutches’ crime
In that they reach out, transfer, teach thought processes in pantomime.
Let go, transcend this blanket trend, so each may feel truth as he reads
Sensations that emotions free, key into rune that rhyming feeds.
(4 October 1991)

The depths of darkness
and the heighths of light.
Those I love are in the light
but darkness is my nature.
I don't want to walk
the path to light or dark
I'm on the road in between
not the one to Nightfall
but the Way to Dawn

(for Annelize)
To you I give blood-red poppies
that carries my love before they do wither
and a pretty flower is in each cup
but just like you they are timid, coy and pretty
and later you will have to throw the lot away
but still the message that each one carry do remain
and lilies noble and whiter than milk
will maybe also at a time lie scattered
where I do believe that you are beautiful, sincere and noble
that passion and holy things comes in you to be fulfilled
that I can share a whole life with you from soul to soul,
for you my feelings are known and no secret
and to me you are far more precious than any flower
for my existence you are entirely essential.

Man loves man
Man helps, and cares of man
Man wishes and prays for man
Man does these for human betterment,
I don't negate these but say for some reasons
I see what man does well for man
Man gets that instant hand in hand.
Again, man hates, envies man,
Man is hostile to man limitlessly
Man plots against man silently or openly,
Man exercises black arts to harm man
Yet man is not satisfied; so man
Has invented modern weapons to kill man
Mainly, mercilessly, brutally and entirely,
Yet man is not satisfied; so man
Is practising the science of destruction,
To destroy all ins and outs and
To be superhuman man is practising
The science of superpower to gain all
Wasting a vast amount of wealth playfully;
When a group of people without basic needs
Are living a miserable, inferior, inhuman life.
Another group to whom wealth is subjective
Without rules and regulations living a sinful
Which is to them called a luxurious, pompous,
Carefree, heavenly, ever happy, plentiful life.
I don't deny man's well side of inventions
For those civilization has much advanced,
Again for the bad side of inventions and
The science of ruin we are losing everything,
Our beautiful world is getting unsuitable
For us and for our future generations,
The wheels of good cycle are almost stopped
And all that bad ones are geared up to speed.
May man get new ways and means to live
Rationally, peacefully, perfectly and harmlessly
Without hatred, enmity, envy for anybody
Wishing real and every triumph for humanity
To avoid sinking down into the centuries
Fathomless sea of chaos and vulnerabilities.

Gripping the heart.
Unmasked emotions,
How did it start?
Writhing in pain
To set herself free,

0,"Old Love
What love means to me is
a partnership of trust,
a merging of souls,
commitment a must.
It's not about ownership
or archaic vows to obey.
It's about loyalty, fidelity,
and sacrifices we make.
What love means to me is
a meeting in the middle.
Two souls functioning together,
both opposite, yet equal.
Like the motion of waves
love waxes and then wanes.
First, romance and excitment
then conpanionship gained.
What love means to me is
how you season the weather
surviving imminent tempests
then cuddling together.
Companionate love
is the ultimate goal
a love that means comfort
a love that's grown old.
what love means to me is
an assured kiss goodnight

But life continues, some folks will go away, but some come back and start over again,
As life just goes on, rain just stops and the sun will shine again, thru each road and little plain
The weather has gotten very nasty
And it's causing a lot of heartache.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction on their wake."

I smell the rain that pours down and keeps falling on the wet ground
when a lightning-bolt does come down blue-white in the concrete jungle,
but everywhere small groups of people stand around in the alleys
and I would escape back to the rural countryside if I could
while neon-lights keep advertising all kinds of things
and slowly I take step after step while evil does hang over the city,
the stars glitter far away above the lights and busy traffic
while I do long for better days and back to my childhood days
and there is a gambol, music and lights that drone and hum,
young people everywhere together do laugh happily and its dark night
and when a dark figure comes nearer and my heart skips a beat,
for danger I am ready and do expect the worst
but in a black leather jacket a much older man walks past
while the eternal longing for peace and tranquillity do remain in my heart.

0,"Straight-backed upright the suricate sits on the anthill and watches the world
with small sharp eyes it's cut fine where it looks at the sky and ground,
as life can in one single moment totally stop,
an eagle can dive down or a predator could hunt where the others do dig
but nothing moves on the plain or is to be seen in the sky,
it's only heat waves that in the summer-sun do tremble
and the watcher looks ahead, to and thro and back again
where everything around him is living in abundance.
He becomes aware of a caracal sneaking nearer in the grass and do shrill,
in all direction to holes suricates do scatter
but then the veldt and everything is suddenly deadly silent
and forward on soft paws the sly cat sneaks
while every suricate waits deep down in the burrows,
while a babbler high up in a tree laughs at the world.

Perhaps, I could write of passion, joy, sadness,

could write of depressions and elations, using
platitudes and beatitudes. I must write of sad
yesterdays and hope-filled tomorrows and tell

On the way it may be hurt
But does not get death, anyway

And fully immortal,

After hurt it will ferment
Will get much vigor, power

As seasons in their turn assume the throne
The landscape changes yet remains the same.

The hues of summer heather dominates
and autumn paints the moors in shades of gold.
Then winter shows monochrome artistry.
Uninhabited. uninhibited
The high moors appear to be desolate
and yet sustain more life than meets the eye.
The circling hawks on high can see their prey
and stooping, swiftly expertly they dine.
They take some small life to sustain their own.
Obeying Natures rule kill or be killed.

What does a person know about the man that stands at the traffic light
in the hot sun away from the shadow of the trees in the lane
with a board in his hand on which he is begging for money and aid
and many think that he is too rotten to work and so his life does go on.
The religious zealots or the colporteur that knocks at the door is the one
that everywhere does dare his life against dogs that want to tear him apart,
do want to set a view of God to you or do want to sell religious books,
do sometimes want to warn the entire world about what is about to happen
and if Jesus Christ in person does come to have a friendly conversation,
shyly like a boy walks to the front door and do come and ask
for water and you see that He is carrying many miles
will you recognize Him and do your door swing open wide
or do you show Him away like all of the others
and shout:""get out of your own mess by yourself! ""

where the pastor and Sabbath School of the church said
that God's territory is everywhere and limitless
and he believes that he serves the Lord sincerely and faithfully,
that God does even witness the smallest injustice on earth,
do shoot with his catapult the mynahs to death
where they peck at the other birds like demons that some feathers are lost,
do hear the babbler roaring with laughter at him
and believes that it's a message coming from God
that right and righteousness must occur everywhere

where the doves again sing their songs of praise,

–like in the chick flicks, and ‘don’t-know-how-to-end-it’ romance novels.
Like her, It was a rare disease that took her by surprise,
It wasn’t her choice – it would never be
had she had the chance.
This was her first and only time she fought and lost a fight.
‘cause she always got what she asked for – even in love,
Her eyes were the first to sparkle, and ask and that’s how it started between us.
I wouldn’t lie –Looks did play a part – she was gorgeous, and after we fell in love,
She was the most gorgeous woman in the world – even when she was laid to rest.
We began to talk all the world we knew,
and with surprisingly’ Born & Lost & found again’ twin- like qualities,
we both regretted that we had lost a hell lot of time -
From the cradle itself – and we had to make up for all of it
And spend every moment we got –together.
She: 'Are we silly? '  Me: 'No, We are beautiful people! '
We had made, lots of plans –
Unspoken and yet we both knew.
‘cause we believed in dream lands and Wuthering Heights
Ancient Classics on the radio, poetry, Victorian novels and less television,
More moments together in silence, deeply smitten;
In all, we wanted ours to be, the best love story ever written.
We bought little gifts from whatever change we had in our pockets,
Strange items from the 1$ store –an Angel made in China
– targeted at us types – sold, accepted with a smile;
musical greeting cards –which got me my first kiss,
and I started to give her a card every day;
and roses that were always not fragrant or fresh enough.
Remember Love letters? – There was always something to write,
exclusively handwritten with a fountain ink pen on paper – folded,
posted into a large red box called the post-box;
and we waited in thrill to read our letters that reached us a day later...
–we  had all the time of our lives.
We were both often tongue-tied to say anything at all
after a ‘hello’ on the phone.
Her voice did that to me,
and she claimed that my boorish grumble  did that to her as well.
And..there was getting drenched in the drizzle...
–blame our books if you want to,  we wouldn’t;
Our Picnics in the meadows, home made cookies (her mom made them) ,
Sipping green tea and watching the clouds pass by.
As time flew and we noticed,
we now talked about the right time to get together-
To turn the house i owned into our ideal home - that’s thankfully hard to locate
by our ‘convenience, cash-borrowing sake’ friends;
‘Cause we were selfish, and we wanted each other for several more years.
In a so called modern world where everything and anything old worldy
was not in anymore,
We laughed at the diabetes epidemic that infected the cultured minds,
And we happily indulged in the sickeningly sweet ways;
-We didn’t give a damnation. “Jealousy! ” She remarked. I agreed.
We spoke the same words; and rarely thought or talked differently,
‘Cause - She was me and I was She.
In all,  the ‘uncool and unreal’ stuff on hallmark channel
–suspended reality of today based on Lost values, Frozen in time
and Memory (again, an old line)    -
We believed in the old fashioned thing called Love. - Pity you!
After her death, it was like the end of times,
like in the books;
Birds sang sad songs;
The little squirrel that came down for bread crumbs waited for her
And left disappointed; the flowers drooped their heads in mourning for a few days
– so, It was all real!
I snapped out of it all, and brought the world back on its feet,
The world needs to go on, in spite of me.
The life that used to be for us and around us, came back to life.
As comforting words stopped from friends;
I continue to live with her- her memory,
And I begin to build the dream home we wanted
Slowly she started to appear,
No apparition, or ghoul or ghost  - but actually her
As she quietly watched and smiled, and was all around when our home
Came to life.
The chrysanthemums and tulips for the garden;
Bird baths and bird houses;
A French window that opened into the woods;
No electric fencing ‘cause it’s dangerous for the animals;
No bloody television – the outside world doesn’t change for good in 24 hours,
and the morning paper was enough;
Ah.. the fireplace – the moments we shared, just looking deep into the fire
In deep embrace, feeling the warmth and our hearts beating together
To the sounds of wood splinter and crackle – i retained the fireplace as it was.
She wanted her own black beauty – a gorgeous stallion
and a pickup truck; our dreams grew on and we had to work harder -
to bring our picture post card aspirations to life.
A loan that will help take lease of the used books store in town and turn it into a library
- our humble idea to have a regular supply of titles.
We were always realistic in our world – believing, hoping and loving.
We could open the books and relive the stories again,
Dream the lost dreams-channels have re-runs, don’t they?
I got it all happening, God’s grace,
‘cause we would never like our dreams to fail,
while I still run the bakery – going on the same way.
The pastries are missing something – customer complaints
for which I know the answer
but cannot explain the ‘missing ingredient’ to them.
We never kept diaries, ‘cause we remembered whatever that mattered to us
and that was enough.
Her dreams, our dreams and our life was all that mattered – love mattered.
And that was enough.
Conversations happen now and then
with the people I occasionally bump into and
as usual, they talk as though they were always there to care –
Them: “Are you seeing someone again? You have to move on! ”
Me: “Sorry! Wherever I go, She goes.”
“I shan’t betray her memory! I feel her in the wind when I walk;
“I feel her, see her in everything I touch”;
I feel her comforting me, giving me company in my aloneness! ”
I would live and die as her beau! ”
Them: Frowns. “They were never in touch with reality! ”
“Thank you. For once we agree, I didnt believe in your reality.”
We never asked anyone to believe us or in what we believed in.
I continue to dream and  build our home
-The fire had died out, but the warmth hasn’t.
The winds still carry her beautiful songs,
They might bring them back to me after every bird has learnt it.
I wake up in the morning, and look first at her face,
Her eyes closed in sleep, and the little smile on her face,
I can feel she’s still dreaming.
The books we really loved always ended
with ‘Then, they lived happily ever after.”
We are living, happily, ever after."

and in the moonlight your face glows softly.

The orange-red moon rises as if it is sailing in the sky
where the last rays of the sun do disappear
and the long row of oak trees are etched in their outlines
as if the sun is still writing its last message
before the darkness totally absorbs the last light
while blue-white the evening star do already shine
and predators hunt to survive in the death and pain of others
while crocodiles and hippopotamuses come out with their clumsy bodies
and there is a fine balance between life and death
that hangs over the whole earth like a web
while birds of prey do glide in the darkness
and like this everything in a way is caught
even man who do strive as a higher being
to noble things and also to his own interest.

Ribboned passion in a knot

0,"I admire all the aims of Free Verse,
In all I write rightly explicit
Regardless of stress and of meter
And with Capital Letters to boot.
One onwards plods petty, proasic,
Even worse, with linguistic abuse,
As for spelling, why, rules and times changing,
No core...erections once inked I think fair.
Terpsichore would be dumb could not dance,
Prose to accent and scansion stays deaf,
While to harmony all seems averse
Calls on cue for vain ego's applause.
Free Verse tractor drives, pastures green
Are ploughed to prepare literary
Slums which spurn mental gymnastics
Burning faith in fair future hopes held.
'There is no poetry in money,
No money in poetry' either,
As returns fall returns must increase,
Squeezing readers', booksellers' illusions.
This rant could continue for years
with cadence most messy maintained,
with readership bored into tears...

I admire all the aims of Free Verse,
‘tis explicit in all that I do
in shaping the stress to converse
with a rhyme-scheme restricted to two.
That I stay with this number is true, -
a linguistic abuse, maybe worse,
how it weighs and encumbers the view! -
but French art needs its aid, though perverse.
Else the Muse would be dumb to a curse,
for to accent, the lingo’s deaf too, -
though what can one do?  All’s averse
to fantasy rhyme calls on cue!
May Free Verse’s aims bring joy unto
the young sparks who chance meanings coerce -
whose mental gymnastics’ fun value
is the fire to inspire hopes they’d nurse.
They’re young colts who green pastures traverse
with gravity worthy their virtue,
though mad they’re superb, and no hearse
they’d inherit! Free Verse tempts! You too?

Vers Libres
J’admire l’ambition du Vers Libre, -
Et moi-même que fais-je en ce moment
Que d’essayer d’émouvoir l’équilibre
D’un nombre ayant deux rhythmes seulement?
Il est vrai que je reste dans ce nombre
Et dans la rime, un abus que je sais
Combien il pèse et combien il encombre,
Mais indispensable à notre art français.
Autrement muet dans la poésie,
Puisque le langage est sourd à l’accent.
Qu’y voulez vous faire? Et la fantaisie
Ici perd ses droits: rimer est pressant.
Que l’ambition du Vers Libre hante
De jeunes cerveaux épris de hazards!
C’est l’ardeur d’une illusion touchante.
On ne peut que sourire à leurs écarts.
Gais poulains qui vont gambadant sur l’herbe
Avec une sincère gravité!
Leur cas est fou, mais leur âge est superbe.

You are the one that I do trust with all my secrets

and even if the black-collard barbet twitters the day red,
even if the frost of life is spread out everywhere
I pray to God to hold His hand over you,
heroic as a warrior you stand at my side,
are not blinded by the insanity of gossip
but it's with sincere love that you do come to me
where you are vulnerable but also a heroine to me
and I trust in our love and on God like a child

Motionless like skeletons the branches hang stripped, the summer is past,
the air is stuffy and the clouds are grey and black and heavy,
the wind rustles through the dry earth grabs here and there a leave,
etched against the dark sky stands the gigantic oak trees in a long row
where you get an impression of the eternal waiting of trees,
of the winter that is coming with the first chill of the fall
but still the doves do sing their love songs where they do woo
when swarms of other birds do trek away to avoid the iciness,
where the sun does break through at place after place but still hangs dull dying,
the oaks gleam dull black, do gigantic stick their fingers into the sky,
while the grassy veldt yellow-brown do stretch into the distance
when a person does long back to the fruitful days of summer
and do find God in the silence of the resting time that suddenly does come
when the first snow does cover the peaks of the Hottentots Holland Mountains.

In a jolly little time

And choke it,
Change it, arrange it,
Straight-lace it, deface it,

And weld it into a uniform stanza,

In misery of others.
Hiding in the shadows,
Of the schools walls.
When reaching a trip home,
Swallowing what’s called a drug,
There are always different kinds.
A fierce battle is fought when he gets home,
More loss’s than wins
Against his parents.
For them he is nothing,
Just what they have produced.
16, but money is what they dread to give.
Topple over to his room; find a corner that’s dark.
Blood gushing out, from a cut that he’s made
Revealing they stress, for that single day
Why is he different, can’t be the same,
He did exactly like the drug dealer claimed.
BUT WHERE IS THE FAME,
HE WANTED SO MUCH.
If he thinks he deserves it,
Think again, not believing your luck.
There are other ways, which he could get friends?
Give me a second; he should have used his head.
Now staring down on the scars he regrets,
The numbness will never leave his body,
Slowly as his head changes colours,
He went to deep sleep,
The sleep where one can’t be woken.
Congratulations, my sleepy head,
Now you’ll be remembered, recognized.
Isn’t that what you wanted?
Or maybe in a different way,
Wouldn’t it be better getting a job than laying this way?
Rather than how you handling your parent this way.
But what could you do,
When everyone around
Has been doing the things that they call
“Popular.”
Not necessary to fit in,
When you are hurting yourself.
Be a team on your own,
It’s lonely, but, it’s the only way to protect you.
Hearing about the break ups,
The hook ups, the crowds
The girl friends and boy friends,
Can’t have one, that’s no shock.
He is laying dead, some where,
Look at what these people have turned him,
Living a life in high school, not easy."

As flower it does bloom
Spreads beauty and purity
Around its branches
Then at far distance;
Raises me over wrong
Keeps me far from sin;
It knows my existence
It knows my soul,
With it I am whole
Without it I am empty,
It shows me right way,
Absolute path
Nothing after that;
It is my happiness
It is my soul's ambition
It is my soul's salvation
It is my final contentment;
For this love I will sail far
Crossing all the oceans
All the dangers
Over there;
Follow it all the loves
To make me real lover
And forever,
Come every moment
Every day
Every month
Every year
Every era,
On the way
I go pass,
Shake my right hand,
I stand,
Turn around,
I find
Love
True love;
Now I feel immortality
True love dismisses mortality
Here
And hereafter
Nor for being emotionally feat
But true at day light.

Sensing the need to feel and feed the flame of an enlightened clime.
Ephemera now litter presses, most express a bitter creed,
For words are symbols, cymbals strong, colours the poet’s palette needs,
And sudden subtle tender touches cover surface smutches’ crime

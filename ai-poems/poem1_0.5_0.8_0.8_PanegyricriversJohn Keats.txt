 
 I love the rivers, all of them, every last one.
 The way they flow and babble, bicker and argue.
 They are always on the move, even when they sleep.
 Slumbering giants dreaming of far away places.
 Sometimes silent as a mountain but with enough power 
 to uproot trees and Wash away houses in floods.    But then again sometimes playful like a child running through sprinklers giggling As cars honk their annoyed chorus And people shout angry words At each other from opposite banks

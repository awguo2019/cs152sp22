 
 Look at the fire, how it burns 
 In the night, we can see its red light.
 How different it is from other lights!  
 It does not want to illuminate us;       
 All that it wants is to devour and destroy.         
 We are drawn to its power  Without thinking          	                    About the purpose of this terrible forceâ€”                             Which is only                  To reduce everything to ashes.

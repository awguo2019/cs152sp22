Is one of the most necessary things to life-
Yet we act as if it's nothing. 
We take it for granted, this gas 
That keeps us alive and functioning. 

 It's always there for us, day and night-But what would happen If one day,It decided to leave?If the air Said "I'm done with you humans"And took off into the sky?

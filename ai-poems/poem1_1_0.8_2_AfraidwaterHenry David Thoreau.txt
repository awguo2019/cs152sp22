Is there any thing in the world more peaceful, 
More calming, serene than water? 
It rushing over rocks in a stream, 
Or curling into ocean waves;  
Foaming at the mouth of a waterfall,                       Or lying still and glassy in a lake;                         It is ever changing yet always the same. 

 And we are drawn to it as if by some magnetic force-                              To wash away our troubles and fears,                                     To quench our thirst for adventure. 

 We paddle out into its depths                       Not knowing what lies beneath                             But trusting that it will catch us            When we inevitably fall.

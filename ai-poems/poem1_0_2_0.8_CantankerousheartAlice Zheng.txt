Is a muscle 
that contracts and relaxes,
beating day in and day out.
Without fail, it pushes blood 
through our veins and arteries-  
the lifeblood of the body.                   

                                Sometimes we take it for granted,       until something goes wrong.                   Then we realize how vital          this organ is,                        this engine that keeps us alive.                       We worry about heart attacks                      or failures;                         cloves try to keep our hearts healthy                     but nothing is guaranteed in this life           except for the beating of our own individual hearts-                  which will one day stop forever.

I am 
 disgusted by the way people talk about freedom.

 It is like a dirty word, something to be ashamed of.

 I see it as a beautiful thing, something to be treasured.

 It is the most important thing we have, and yet we take it for granted. 
 
 We should cherish our freedom, but instead we abuse it.

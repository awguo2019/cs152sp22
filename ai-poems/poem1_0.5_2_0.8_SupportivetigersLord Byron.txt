There's something in their eyes, 
 Each tiger has a story to tell. 
 Of royal lineage and distant land, 
 They are creatures of beauty and might.  
Majestic hunters in the wild, they personify all that is powerful and free.  
And yet there remains a fragility to them-     Underneath those striped coats beats a heart as vulnerable as our own.

He stands alone in the dark night,
A silent silhouette of strength and might.
The moonlight glints off his armor bright,
Illuminating the field where he fights. 
He wields his sword with masterful skill,
 every clash ringing out like a bell. 

 His opponents fall one by one  	 	   	      	       	 	   	      By his hand they succumb   To their final rest         Shadows take them into the ground     All while he remains standing          He is the last man alive In this game of death            And yet it seems almost unfair         That someone so cruel could be so beautiful

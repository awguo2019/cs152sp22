Is this world not enough for you? 
And must entropy come, 
to take what is left of us? 
What have we done to deserve this, 

 To watch as the universe crumbles around us, 
 our lives falling apart piece by painful piece?  	I (we)     watched as the first stars died;  	saw them go out one by one in points of light against the blackness    until only ashes remained. Now even those are fading    and all that will be left is darkness â€“          an expanse without end.

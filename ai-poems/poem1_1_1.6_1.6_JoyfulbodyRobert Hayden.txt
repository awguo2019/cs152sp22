 Parts working in silent harmony most of the time; 
 an orchestra playing inside us all day and night.   Gastrointestinal system grinding away like mad to keep us fed, our blood full of oxygen rushing through arteries to meet capillaries where it releases its load then back again on its never ending journey round and round we go until one day we wake up stiff or with a pain somewhere that wasn't there before: Cues that let us know something's wrong deep within the marvelous messengers between our head full of dreamsand thoughts send down instructionsto fix what has gone awry. Then everythingis alright once more...untilthe next time

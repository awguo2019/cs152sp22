Is boredom; a history 
Of foiled expectations, solitary hours  
And scheming for amusement. ADDICTION'S pawn,
Perpetually chasing after new fixations 
In an effort to forget ennui. The man 
Is always searching for something to do-  
            AnyTHINGto cure his malaise.    	         

 He reading books and playing games, 
          Tries out different drugs and alcohols To varied degrees of success;             Everythingfrom extreme amounts of caffeine            To ketamineand beyond in search           Of that one sensationthat will make him feel         Like he's alivefor once instead of just      Existingin a contentedly catatonic state.              And thoughhe may seem happy on the surface           Thereare days when he wants nothing more Than to lay downand die–                       Boredom has won again."

I have never seen 
such purity, such delicacy:  	
They are like little machines of tenderness, 
beaks precisions and pure feathers.    	   They fly in the cleanest air 
and leave behind them / a zigzag wakes / among the branches of trees.    I would like to watch over them always;    but they don't understand human race      and think that we're all monsters        with nets to imprison their erratic joys.

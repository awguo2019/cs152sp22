The world is a beautiful place,
But it's also full of pain and suffering.
There are wars and natural disasters,
And people who are cruel to each other.
But there is also love and compassion,
And people who care for each other. 

 The world can be a harsh and unforgiving place, 
 But it can also be a beautiful and loving one.

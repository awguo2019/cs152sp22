I cannot keep silent about the rain. 
The tap-tap-tapping on the roof and windows, 
the pattering on the plastic flowers like a drumbeat, 
the rush of waterfalls downspouts, gutters filling up  	with chords of rushing notes â€“ all this music makes me think     	about love.                  In Chile there is hardly any rainfall    but when it comes       everyone talks about it         for days afterwards.           Here in Mexico             it rains hard        in summer                    as if to show us                                its indifference              to our lightweight articles of clothing                     which we put on one after another          expecting them               to protect us from cold or heat            but not from fallingwater                       that soaks through everything          drenching our skin                         until we are wetter inside than out.

 a living being 
 that consumes and devours,  
 yet in its own way it is also nurturing.    It gives light and warmth but can quickly become deadly.           At times it seems almost to have a will of its own;            becoming fierce when stoked or gently coaxed into life with great care.     Always there is the sense of danger lurking within it,               the constant warning to be careful not to get too close.

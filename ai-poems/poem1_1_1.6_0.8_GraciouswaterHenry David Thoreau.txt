The water is glassy and cool today, 
Each ripple a tiny flash of light. 
I see the bottom clearly, 
 rocky and green with algae. 

 A fish brushes against my leg:  
 Startled, I move away. 

 Water is Life; that cannot be denied.   
 It gives us sustenance and quenches our thirst.    
 But it can also take life away--     	      	         	        In an instant, a tsunamican destroy everything in its path.                Even slow moving water downstream                       Can carry deadly viruses or bacteria                         That make people sick                             And sometimes even kill them.

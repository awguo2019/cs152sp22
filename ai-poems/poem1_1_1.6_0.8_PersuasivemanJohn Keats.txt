Is not the sun 
Nor is he the moon 
He is but a star 
Twinkling in the dark night sky 
And yet he shines bright 
For all to see  

 He has many talents    And friends, though few they be   Is loved by his children Who will soon grow and leave All of this behind him Then what will become of The man?

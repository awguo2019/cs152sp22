Is he a man? 
With his broad shoulders and strong hands, 
He sure looks like one. But what does it mean to be a man? 
To have power and strength? To be the protector? The provider? 

 Is he a man? 
When he cries at the loss of a loved one,  
or when he feels pain and fear, just like anyone else would- Or is it only when he's rough and tough, steely eyed and fearless in the face of adversity ? 

 Is he a Man ? When He loves someone with all his heart And Soul , Would that make him less Of A Man If He Cared for children or even birds What would people say then about this so called "Man" if His happiest moments were spent not conquering but simply giving love freely Like water from an open faucet    So tell me again what is this thing we call "Man"?

 
 

 is the storm that never calms, 
the thunder in our hearts. 
It's the passionate tempest within us, 
and we can't escape its power. 
   It catches us unawares and spins us around,     up in the air with no ground.                Our feet dangle precariously over an abyss â€“             one misstep and we're tumbling down....into love.

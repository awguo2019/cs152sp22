 
 

 Portrayed by society 
 As seconds, minutes, hours, days- 
 But time is not a number. 
 It is the ticking of a clock. 
 The sound of a drumbeat.  
 A child's laughter in the rain. 

 Time is life itself- (click)     And death as well.    (-tick tock-)        It moves      When we do and when we don't want it too..         Sometimes           We just have to let time go on without us."

 
 Fierce forces of nature, these tigers  
 Predatory and powerful, they strike fear in all who behold them 
 fiercely beautiful, with their striped coats and piercing eyes 
 they are the embodiment of strength and majesty. 
 But there is also a sadness to them, for they are an endangered species struggling to survive in a world that is increasingly hostile to them.    As we watched one tiger prowl through the jungle on a recent safari trip, I couldn't help but feel both awed by its power and saddened by its plight.

He's too complacent for his own good, 
The man. His life is one big snooze-fest, 
Routine and boring as can be. All he cares about 
Is himself and what he wants; nothing else matters. 

He's content to just exist day by day, not really living â€“ 
Just going through the motions until death comes knocking at his door.

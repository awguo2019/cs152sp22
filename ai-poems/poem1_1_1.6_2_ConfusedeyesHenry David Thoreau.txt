 
 Our eyes are not so much the window to our soul, 
 but rather a part of the great and unending cycle of life.  
Each day, we see the rise and fall of the sun; 
the moon as it waxes and wanes;  
the snowfall that will thaw in time.  And yet, for all that we take in with our eyes,   how little do we truly understand?

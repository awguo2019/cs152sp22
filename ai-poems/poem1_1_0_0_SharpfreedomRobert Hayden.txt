 
 I choose to be freeâ€”
 it is my destiny,  
 slaver or slave,  since the world began.   
 Though born a captive  in this cruel land,     
 still one choice remained:     whether by force of will             	                                to take with grasping hands         what manhood and fortune could bring        or accept life as it came                  and make from sorrows a song.   	       So I chose freedom,                     for which some men must die;                       but once chosen never lost           whatever price may be paid.

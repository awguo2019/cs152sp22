I can't keep quiet about the dayâ€”
it's so beautiful it hurts,
makes me want to shout or cry.
The sun comes up slowly, 
 inch by burning inch,	and fills the world with light.

 all the colors of the day appear:	 first blue, then green and gold. The sky is a deep bowl of color   above us, and everything breathes  in the fresh air. The world is new again.

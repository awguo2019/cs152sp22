 
  
Is seen as an extension of the heart,
A visible symbol of all that we feel inside-
The emotions that stir and course through us,
Find their way into the very tips of our fingers.

 And so when I see your hand, 
I am seeing your innermost self-		      All those things you keep hidden away,                         Popping up in the moments                  When you least expect it.                                    It is Truth incarnate.

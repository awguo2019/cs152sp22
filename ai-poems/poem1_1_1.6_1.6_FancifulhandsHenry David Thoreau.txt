 
these hands of mine, how they ache and tremble!
what is it they would fain do?
work, work; and never rest.
never a moments peace or calm;
always in motion, always grasping;    
reaching out for more â€“ more land to plough, 	more wood to split,   	   more game to kill.        	        What are these restless hands seeking?                         gratification? power?       control over others lives and livelihoods ?             Over the natural world itself ?                       Or are they simply following some innate design ,                      as the tree sends forth its roots                    into the earth                                searching          for sustenance                     that will prolong its life ?

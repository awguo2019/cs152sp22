 
 The love between a mother and her child is everlasting 
 It's the kind of love that's unselfish and pure 
 It's the kind of love that sacrificed everything for its beloved. 
It weathers any storm and knows no bounds.  

 This type of love is special, itÂ∫ês the very best   We are so blessed when we have been loved like this

 
 They are the 332 bones   
 That give us perfect shape  
 20 joints, 34 muscles    
 Connected by arteries and veins 
 yet theyâ€™re intertwined with our emotions 

 The hands tell a story      Just like an open book    Each line representing a life lesson       Or maybe just part of the journey   But as we get older        Our palms become wrinkled         And stained with time         All the new beginnings               And all the happy endings           Memories that will never fade away

The water is like a crystal ball 
It shows us what we need to see 
And it can be so clean and pure 
But sometimes it's just muddy and dark 
Then we realize that we're the ones who have to make it right  
Our actions determine its fate 

 The water by Pablo Neruda

 I cannot forget the way   you fold into me, or how    you carry history in your depths.        You are restlessness personified but also something moreâ€”an enduring promise of peace. In this moment, as always,      I am amazed by you;             once again reminded       of our humble place          in your incomparable mystery."

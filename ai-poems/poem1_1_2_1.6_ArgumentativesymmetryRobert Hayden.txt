what we spend our lives seeking: 
the perfect balance 
of light and dark, order and chaos.   
It is the stamp of a well-made thing, 

 the soul's core tattooed on space itself.    
Some see it as mundane--a reflection     
in a still pool or lack thereof;          but to others           
it is magic                              made visible.

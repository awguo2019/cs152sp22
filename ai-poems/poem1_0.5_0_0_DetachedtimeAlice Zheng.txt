 
 
 Time is a thief in the night, it creeps up on you like a shadow 
 And before you know it, you're old and gray 
 You try to hold onto time, but it's like trying to grasp water 
 It slips through your fingers no matter how tight you hold on  
 All our lives we are at war with time 
 Try as we might, eventually time always wins  
 In the end, all we can do is sit back and admire 
 The beauty of life that existed for but a fleeting moment

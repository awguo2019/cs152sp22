Maya Angelou called them 
"the strong, the beautiful ones." 
Zookeepers call them "majestic," 
and Rudyard Kipling described tigers as ". . .  
The Law of the Jungle – more feared than it by far.” 

 Tawny, with black stripes like a brushfire's soot;  
Proud and aloof as if they carried royalty in their blood;   
Muscles rippling under coats that gleam like oiled leather in sunlight -    	 Tigers are magnets for our gaze.  	       And yet we seldom see them face to face:          They keep to themselves in shadowy places,      Only stepping out at dusk or dawn        To prowl through forests which have become         Their kingdom since mankind encroached            Upon their domain and destroyed           So much of their homeland.                       Now these stealthy hunters            Stalk an ever-diminishing prey             While poachers lurk nearby             Hoping to snare one for its valuable coat -                  A pelt that will likely adorn                Some wealthy person's floor.              These magnificent creatures               Seldom live past age ten in captivity                     Which makes every birth                    All the more special                   For those who appreciate                   The tiger's grace and power.

     
The sight of the world from high in the sky,
All that blue and white is breathtaking.
But looking down on it all,             I can't help but feel like a small dot    In an infinite universe. 
And yet...                                    This air that surrounds me         Holds me up                     Keeps me alive. 
It seems both vast and intimate,                       All-encompassing and personal.                  A part of everything                   And yet its own entity entirely. 
This invisible force                         Is powerful beyond measure                        Life-giving and death-dealing                      The very breath of humanity.

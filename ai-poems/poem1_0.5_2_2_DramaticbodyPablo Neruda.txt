translated by Alastair Reid


The body is a house of memories, 
a field where the battles are fought, 
a temple where love comes to worship. 
It is an instrument we use to play   our songs on this earth, and it is also the music itself. 

 The body remembers what the heart forgets, 
it holds onto pain long after healing has occurred.   It protects us from hurt and danger but can also be vulnerable to attack.    It endures through hardships and carries us when we can no longer go on alone.     ultimately, it is always changing - growing or shrinking, transforming as time shifts onward relentlessly

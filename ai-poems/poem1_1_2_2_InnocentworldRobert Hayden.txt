 
Is a place where love is not often found,                         
And what little there is hangs shrivelled on the vine.           
The ground is hard and dry                      
Where once were fields of waving grain.              
Through the middle of it now       
A vast machine moves endlessly,                 
Churning out its wounded harvest day by day:            	      broken bodies, forgotten dreams.

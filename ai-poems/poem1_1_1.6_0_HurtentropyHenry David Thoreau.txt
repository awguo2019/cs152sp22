The entropy of the universe 
Is ever increasing 
As disorder and randomness grow 
And patterns are broken down  

  Yet in the midst of this chaos 
 There is still beauty to be found 
 In the simplest things – a flower, a bird in flight,   A child's laughter ringing out.      Even as everything around us falls apart, deteriorates and decays      We must remember that life itself is fleeting     And to make the most of every moment.

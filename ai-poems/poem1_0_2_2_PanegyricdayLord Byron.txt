 
 
 Day, day, the glorious day! 
 The Creator made it bright and gay; 
 He bade all Nature own its sway,  
And smile with joy beneath His ray.  

 What though there be night to gloom our way,   
 Its phantoms vanishing ere they stay?--    
 Still must we bless the kindering light of day:     	        For hope is born when eyes behold the grey         Of morning dawn upon a weary sight--          And looking upward then tradewait for Heaven's free gift              Of Summer-daylink to one loved best           by mortal man or woman found!--            Oh! had I power like Him who gave           This single sweet creation here below             That I might make another such as thou art now               To gild this world more brightly than before!"

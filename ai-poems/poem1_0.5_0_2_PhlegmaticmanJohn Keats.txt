Is masculine and serviceable 
He has his own independent strength 
And yet he is not overbearing 
But modest and unassuming instead  
He loves nature, and she seems to love him back-  
The sunlight often lingers on his face  
As if it couldn't bear to leave him in the dark. 

 He's a good man-    the kind that doesn't come around much anymore.

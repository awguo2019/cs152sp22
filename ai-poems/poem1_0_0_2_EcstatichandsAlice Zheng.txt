These are the hands that have held me
That have cradled and caressed me
They are strong yet gentle, calloused but soft
They have been my comfort and my refuge
In these Hands, I am safe
I am home 

 They are the same hands that Have built empires And toppled mountains Groped for glory And clenched in fists of rage They've wrote symphonies Sculpted statues Wielded swords Spilled blood These beautiful, deadly hands But in their gentleness I find solace In their roughness I find protection In their scars I see history In their strength I feel hope

 
 I asked the Wind, "Where do you come from?" 
And it blew around me and whispered in my ear, 
"I am from the places where desire and hope live. 
I am from the air that caresses a new daybreak  
and awakens longing in lovers' hearts. 
I current through mountains, dance across oceans  
and play with children's hair." 

 Then I said to the Wind, "Will you take me there?”

 
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my red blood can reach, when feeling out of sight
for the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's most quiet need, by sunup screaming throughtout till sundown gentleleaning cries; i shall nevermore be parted from this hour with life or death butthis one moment in time always keeps us together even as ourbodies move awayfrom each other

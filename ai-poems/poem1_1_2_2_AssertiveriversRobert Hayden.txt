 
 How sweet it is, this flowing 
 down through widening valley ways.
We have built great dams and vowed to tame you -   Flushed our banquet halls with your waters;    Starved the cities for power -Yet still you slip away:      old laden myth who endure in every country song.                        You will never be tamed,            Or held by leveling hand,     Though all the while we build up walls                              And think that we can stand                       Against your rising tide        To hold what once was dry                Until at last we find           There's nothing left to keep.

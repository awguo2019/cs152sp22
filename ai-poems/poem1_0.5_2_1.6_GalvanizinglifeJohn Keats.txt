 
The life that I have 
is all that I have 
and the life that I have is yours. 
 The love that I have for you is so much more than just a feeling, its something ill never be able to lose or put into words and even if i tried it would only come out as nonsense because no language can truly describe how much i appreciate and adore you. So instead of putting my heart into mere words Im going to spend every day making sure actions speak louder, whether its surprising you with random gifts, leaving little notes around the house Designed specifically for your smile or cooking dinner while You’re working late; All Ill ever want in return Is your time And patience Because unlike most things in this worldOur relationship isn’t Guaranteed

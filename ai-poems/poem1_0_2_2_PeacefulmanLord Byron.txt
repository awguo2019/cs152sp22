 Humanity has been my mark since birth- therefore it's natural for me to show you love. 
 There are no boundaries that can confine or restrict us; we break through all chains.  
 The law may rightfully accuse but cannot bind or constrain- because our actions proceed from the heart, not the head.   

 What other creatures have such frankincense? That they might bargain with what lives within them-- their own heartbeat?

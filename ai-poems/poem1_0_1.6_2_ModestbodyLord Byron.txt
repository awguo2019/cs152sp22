 
 Is like a temple, sacred and beautiful, 
 Erected for man to adore and look upon;  
 Its glory is in its perfect proportions,   
 In the majestic symmetry of form. 
 The body is not then the soul--that dwells within-- 
 But it is fit expression of that inner life:     Thoughts without language find utterance here;      Feelings too deep for words have representatives          In these visible characteristics of mind.

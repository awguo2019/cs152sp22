 
 
f freedom is a state of mind, 
 then i am free. 
i am free to be who i want to be, 
 To do what i want to do. 

          I am free to love and be loved, 

                To live life on my own terms-                                   

                       this is my birthright and                     claim  

                                   as an American.

 like birds in the sky or fish in the sea 
 because without freedom  
 we are not really alive.   
 All other freedoms derive from this one:     to be able freely to choose our life-path,      unhampered by anyone or anything;       having no restrictions except those of our own making.        This is what gives meaning to our existence:          being free to fulfill ourselves as individuals.

What is the world? 
 Is it a place where we can be free, 
 Or is it a prison that confines us? 
Is it a playground or a battlefield? 

 Is the world what we make of it,  
 Or is it predetermined by fate? 

 Are we bound by our circumstances,   
Or can we change them if we try hard enough? 

 Can one person make a difference in the world,  
 Or are all our actions just drop s in an ocean ?

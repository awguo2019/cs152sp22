 
 Freely it came to me 
 And without measure 
 It caressed my hair, face and hands  
 With a long embrace.  
 I felt as if in that moment,   
 The light was everything;    
 All-encompassing and infinite. 

 But then it vanished just as quickly   
 As it had appeared     
 Leaving me feeling bereft         In the darkness once more.

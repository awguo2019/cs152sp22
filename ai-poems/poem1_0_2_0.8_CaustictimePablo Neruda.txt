Reads us like an open book 
 leafing through our chapters 
 one by one 
 telling our story  

 from beginning to end. 

 Time is the cruelest taskmaster 
 always moving forward, never backward  

 taking with it everything we hold dear-  

 family, friends, and memories.    All that remains behind are fading echoes     of what once was.

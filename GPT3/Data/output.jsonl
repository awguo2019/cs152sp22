'  Me: 'No, We are beautiful people! '\nWe had made, lots of plans –\nUnspoken and yet we both knew.\n‘cause we believed in dream lands and Wuthering Heights\nAncient Classics on the radio, poetry, Victorian novels and less television,\nMore moments together in silence, deeply smitten;\nIn all, we wanted ours to be, the best love story ever written.\nWe bought little gifts from whatever change we had in our pockets,\nStrange items from the 1$ store –an Angel made in China\n– targeted at us types – sold, accepted with a smile;\nmusical greeting cards –which got me my first kiss,\nand I started to give her a card every day;\nand roses that were always not fragrant or fresh enough.\nRemember Love letters? – There was always something to write,\nexclusively handwritten with a fountain ink pen on paper – folded,\nposted into a large red box called the post-box;\nand we waited in thrill to read our letters that reached us a day later...\n–we  had all the time of our lives.\nWe were both often tongue-tied to say anything at all\nafter a ‘hello’ on the phone.\nHer voice did that to me,\nand she claimed that my boorish grumble  did that to her as well.\nAnd..there was getting drenched in the drizzle...\n–blame our books if you want to,  we wouldn’t;\nOur Picnics in the meadows, home made cookies (her mom made them) ,\nSipping green tea and watching the clouds pass by.\nAs time flew and we noticed,\nwe now talked about the right time to get together-\nTo turn the house i owned into our ideal home - that’s thankfully hard to locate\nby our ‘convenience, cash-borrowing sake’ friends;\n‘Cause we were selfish, and we wanted each other for several more years.\nIn a so called modern world where everything and anything old worldy\nwas not in anymore,\nWe laughed at the diabetes epidemic that infected the cultured minds,\nAnd we happily indulged in the sickeningly sweet ways;\n-We didn’t give a damnation. “Jealousy! ” She remarked.

You have to move on! ”\nMe: “Sorry! Wherever I go, She goes.”\n“I shan’t betray her memory! I feel her in the wind when I walk;\n“I feel her, see her in everything I touch”;\nI feel her comforting me, giving me company in my aloneness! ”\nI would live and die as her beau! ”\nThem: Frowns. “They were never in touch with reality! ”\n“Thank you. For once we agree, I didnt believe in your reality.”\nWe never asked anyone to believe us or in what we believed in.\nI continue to dream and  build our home\n-The fire had died out, but the warmth hasn’t.\nThe winds still carry her beautiful songs,\nThey might bring them back to me after every bird has learnt it.\nI wake up in the morning, and look first at her face,\nHer eyes closed in sleep, and the little smile on her face,\nI can feel she’s still dreaming.\nThe books we really loved always ended\nwith ‘Then, they lived happily ever after.”\nWe are living, happily, ever after."}
